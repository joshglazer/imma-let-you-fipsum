        On September 13, 2009, the world changed forever. Everyone was tuned
        into the <strong>MTV Video Music Awards</strong>, and was anxiously
        awaiting to hear who would win the award for{" "}
        <strong>Best Video by a Female Artist</strong>. As we all waited on the
        edge of our seats for Shakira and Taylor Lautner to announce the winner,
        we had no idea what was about to happen. <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>{" "}
        was announced as the winner, and the crowd went crazy. But not everyone
        was happy. As soon as <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> started her
        acceptance speech, <strong>Kanye West</strong> ran onto the stage and
        said{" "}
        <span style={quoteKanyeWestStyles}>
          "Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, Imma let you finish, but Beyonc√©
          had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all
          time!"
        </span>{" "}
        Then, true to his word, Kanye left the stage and let Taylor finish her
        speech.
